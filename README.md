# shells
various web shells I've made for pentest work


- recviking_shell.war
  - Decent war package shell. Maintains pseudo history, pseudo path state, and pseudo tab/path completions. This is *NOT* a TTY shell. Functions cross platform Windows and Linux hosts. A .war file is really just a zip. Zip the contents of the directory to create the .war package for deployment. I would have done it for you, but it's bad form to put non-text files with potentially hazardous outcomes on here - examine the contents and make the package yourself.
- recviking_shell.jsp
  - Decent jsp shell. Maintains pseudo history, pseudo path state, and pseudo tab/path completions. This is *NOT* a TTY shell. Functions cross platform Windows and Linux hosts.
- recviking_shell.cgi.py
  - Decent python cgi shell. Maintains pseudo history, pseudo path state, and pseudo tab/path completions. This is *NOT* a TTY shell. Functions cross platform Windows and Linux hosts. Windows host not tested, but should work.
- recviking_shell.php
  -Decent PHP shell. Maintains pseudo history, pseudo path state, and pseudo tab/path completions. This is *NOT* a TTY shell. Functions cross platform Windows and Linux hosts.
- recviking_shell.aspx
  -Classic asp (vb) shell. Maintains pseudo history, pseudo path state, and pseudo tab/path completions. This is *NOT* a TTY shell. Functions on Windows.
